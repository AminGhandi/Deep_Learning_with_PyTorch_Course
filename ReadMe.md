# Deep Learning with PyTorch Step-by-Step: A Beginner's Guide

This repository contains practical deep learning tasks based on the book "Deep Learning with PyTorch Step-by-Step: A Beginner's Guide" by Daniel. The book covers a wide range of topics, starting from the basics of gradient descent and progressing to fine-tuning large NLP models such as BERT and GPT-2 using HuggingFace. The content is divided into four parts:

## Part I: Fundamentals
- Gradient descent
- Training linear and logistic regressions in PyTorch

## Part II: Computer Vision
- Deeper models and activation functions
- Convolutions
- Transfer learning
- Initialization schemes

## Part III: Sequences
- RNN, GRU, LSTM
- Seq2seq models
- Attention mechanisms
- Self-attention
- Transformers

## Part IV: Natural Language Processing
- Tokenization
- Embeddings
- Contextual word embeddings
- ELMo
- BERT
- GPT-2

Throughout this journey, I will provide detailed explanations for each code cell and write brief yet useful descriptions. Additionally, for each lecture, I will provide thorough instructions and highlight important points.

Please refer to the respective sections and lectures for more information and guidance.
