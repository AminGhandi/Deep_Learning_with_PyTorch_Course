    "### We will be checking x-ray images of lungs and classifying them, with the help of computer vision modeling techniques, as either having pneumonia or being normal. Since this is a healthcare problem it is always best to let the model overpredict. We need to predict with the highest form of accuracy and should have nearly 100% recall if possible, with a high precision score as well. We need to be sure to diagnose any possible case of infection and not misclassify an infected lung as healthy because of small margins. Softmax logits can often be used to determine the prediction rather than a softmax function deciding the class. This is a critical decision based on experience with the data as well as the behavior of the model."
